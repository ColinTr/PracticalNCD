## üîç Overview
This python library proposes an ensemble tools for the Machine Learning problem of [Novel Class Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12028.pdf).

In this library, you will find the following tools illustrated through Jupyter Notebooks:
 - An hyperparameter optimization procedure tailored to transfer the results from the known classes to the novel classes.
 - An estimation of the number of clusters by applying clustering quality metrics in the latent space of NCD methods.
 - Two unsupervised clustering algorithms modified to utilize the data available in the NCD setting.
 - A novel method called PBN (for Projection-Based NCD).


## üêç Setting up the Python environment

### Option 1 - With [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download):

```bash
# Create the virtual environment and install the packages with conda
conda env create --file environment.yml --prefix ./venvpracticalncd

# Activate the virtual environment
conda activate .\venvpracticalncd

# Add package missing from conda repositories
pip install iteration-utilities==0.11.0
```

### Option 2 - Without Anaconda:

Prerequisite: having [Python 3.10.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3109/) the default python 3.10 version.

```bash
# Create the empty virtual environment
py -3.10 -m venv venvpracticalncd

# Activate the virtual environment
# On windows:
  .\venvpracticalncd\Scripts\activate
# On linux:
  source venvpracticalncd/bin/activate
  
# Install the needed packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# And finish by installing pytorch independently
pip install torch==1.12.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```


### Finishing touches

```bash
# Add the virtual environment as a jupyter kernel
ipython kernel install --name "venvpracticalncd" --user

# Check if torch supports GPU (you need CUDA 11 installed)
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```


## üíª Usage
Three notebooks are available:
- **Full_notebook.ipynb** lets you train and evaluate the models when the number of clusters *k* is known in advance.
- **Full_notebook_with_k_estimation.ipynb** (self-explanatory).
- **results_wrt_n_unknown_classes.ipynb** is used to evaluate the performance of all the models when the number of novel classes increases. It was used to generate Figure C1 of Appendix C.


## üìä Datasets
The datasets will be <u>automatically downloaded</u> from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ on the first execution.<br/>
If it fails, please try disabling proxies.

**However**, the data splits for some datasets are random and the results can vary compared to the paper.

The most impacted datasets are:
- LetterRecognition
- USCensus1990
- multiple_feature
